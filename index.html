        university
        my first degree was in economics. This was one of my best moments. I was on to of the world, my confidence grew as i was top of my class. I graduated as the best female sutdent. I felt like i had it all together.

        Life after school.
        No one told me being the best in class will translate to getting a good job. I struggled with doing jobs that were not in line with what i wanted for my career. At this point i became confused as to where my life was headed. I did different jobs, customer service, project mgt,.. but i loved design and i got a job that got me to develop wordpress site. I loved the creativity of doing something behind the scene and seeing the beauty come to life.
